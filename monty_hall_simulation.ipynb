    "On the other hand, if the player decides to switch, the probability of winning is `2/3`, because there are two goats. If the player chooses a goat initially, Monty can only open one door, since there is only one door left with a goat behind it. Thus if the palyer chooses a goat initially, it is certain that they will choose the car by switching."
